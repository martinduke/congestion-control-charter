CONGestion RESponse and Signaling Working Group Charter (CONGRESS)

Work on congestion control usually occurs in the TCP Maintenance (TCPM) or
Transport and Services (TSVWG) working groups. RFC 5033 describes a Best Current
Practice to evaluate new congestion control algorithms as Experimental or
Proposed Standard RFCs. When this workflow was established, TCP was the dominant
consumer of this work, and proposals typically emerged from research groups that
had limited ability and experience with running large scale tests to understand
the implications of their proposals.

In the IRTF, the Internet Congestion Control Research Group (ICCRG) has invited
talks on congestion control research, but has only rarely published RFCs despite
the authority to produce Informational and Experimental ones.

Since RFC 5033 was published, many of these conditions have changed. Proponents
often have the opportunity to test and deploy at scale without IETF review. The
set of protocols using these algorithms has spread beyond TCP and SCTP to
include DCCP, QUIC, and beyond. There is more interest in specialized use cases
such as data centers and real-time protocols. Finally, the community has gained
much more experience with indications of congestion beyond packet loss.

A separate working group can review some of the impediments to early congestion
control work occurring in the IETF, and generalize transport in this area from
TCP to all the relevant transport protocols. The congestion control expertise in
the working group would also make it a natural venue to take on other work
related to indications of congestion, such as delay, and potentially AQM
algorithms.

Accordingly, CONGRESS is chartered to conduct a review of RFC 5033 and consider
a revision that relaxes requirements to encourage more experiments in
the IRTF/IETF. Adoption of standards-track work should consider (1) empirical
evidence of safety and (2) stated intent to deploy by major transport
implementations.

While this charter does not specify further deliverables, CONGRESS is authorized
to adopt other work relating to Congestion Control and AQM without rechartering.
This work may be ongoing in TCPM, CORE, ICCRG, or elsewhere, and if so,
coordination is required to decide between adoption of the work and consultation
on it, based on its maturity, the quality of relevant review in either venue,
and its match with the CONGRESS adoption criteria to be enumerated in the
RFC 5033 update. The following are specifically in scope:

* Algorithms mature enough for standardization. CONGRESS may consider not
only the open Internet, but also algorithms focused on Data Centers, “Controlled
environments”, Multipath, and Internet of Things use cases. Any adopted
document must be clear about the domains to which its operation is restricted,
and any such restriction requires approval of the Responsible AD.

* Algorithms proposed for Experimental status, in consultation with ICCRG, based
on an assessment of their maturity and likelihood of near-term wide-scale
deployment.

* AQM algorithms, in consultation with TSVWG, based on the available time and
reviewing expertise in both groups.

* Tweaks to existing algorithms, such as Slow Start.

* New ways for endpoints to respond to both implicit and explicit congestion
signals, including specification of explicit signals.

* Progression of existing Informational or Experimental RFCs to higher maturity,
if they meet the criteria.

* Operational guidance, in general. 

Proposals that depend on the capabilities of a single transport protocol should
generally remain in the maintenance working group for that protocol (i.e.,
TCPM, QUIC, TSVWG). Documents in CONGRESS should remain as independent of
transport protocol as possible, but they might have short specific instructions
(e.g. a header option or parameter format) for one or more protocols.

CONGRESS is not chartered to publish Informational RFCs documenting the state
of congestion control in the Internet, including assessments of compliance 
with existing standards. Venues, e.g., IRTF, may be more appropriate for
publishing such documents.

Real-time, media adaptation algorithms for peer to peer communications remain the
focus of RMCAT and are not in scope unless that WG closes. However, proposals
for live streaming media adaptation may be applicable to both general purpose
and to RMCAT use cases, in which case CONGRESS can adopt them in consultation
with RMCAT.

Once the chartered deliverables are complete, CONGRESS will not remain open 
simply “in case” further work comes along. However, if the working group has
adopted further work in accordance with the guidelines above, it can 
recharter, add milestones for them, and continue until that work is complete.
